					<h2>Demon King Ganondorf</h2>
					<p>Ganondorf, also known as the Evil King, King of the Gerudo, or Demon King, is a powerful Gerudo warlock and is none other than Ganon, the main antagonist of The Legend of Zelda series,[30] as a human rather than the ferocious boar-like beast. While he technically debuted in the original The Legend of Zelda as his actual monster form, Ganondorf himself made his first appearance in Ocarina of Time, but was first mentioned in A Link to the Past, and has since been present or referred to in some games, though he was absent from the mainline titles starting in Twilight Princess until Tears of the Kingdom. Regardless of his forms, as Ganondorf is indeed Ganon himself as an alter-ego using the aspects of his Triforce of Power, he is the arch-nemesis of Link and Princess Zelda, and the Final Boss in the games which he appears in.</p>
